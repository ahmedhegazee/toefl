# TOEFL Examination System 
TOEFL Examination System  is a my graduation project which is designed to meet the requirements of Faculty of Arts in Kafr Elsheikh University.The TOEFL Exam is devided to three parts Listening , Grammar and Reading .Students solve each part of the exam separately in specific time and in a big hall which leads to cheating. For the listening part , the professors used speakers of the hall to let students listen to the audio and solve its questions but the problem that not all students hear the audio.Making certificates was a big problem for moderator and taking much of time.For each student , the certification is make on photoshop and moderator add his info and print it.Correcting students' answers was made manually and professors took a long time to finish it.
